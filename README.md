TeamMate is an application for managing Azure Dev Ops (ADO) work items and pull requests.

TeamMate was designed from the ground up to manage, search and collaborate on bugs easily. It is built for power users. You can search for or create bugs from anywhere using global keyboard shortcuts. You can track any and all of your ADO queries.

Managing work item queries is simple. You can pin several queries as tiles, filter/group work items on common fields, receive toast notifications when work items change, quickly filter a list of work items using search terms, or do a global search of work items in your local pinned queries.

Pull Requests (PRs) are also first class citizens, and treated almost identically to work items. You get notifications, filtering, search, and quick digests and status of a set of reviews.
